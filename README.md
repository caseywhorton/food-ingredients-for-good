# EDA Questions

1. What foods can be substituted for meats and still have the same amount of protein?
2. How many groups of foods are there based on ingredients?
3. Can we classify foods simply based on their ingredients? Does it make intuitive sense?
4. What foods have the highest sugar, protein, fat, or calories?
